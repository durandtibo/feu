## API stability

:warning: While `hya` is in development stage, no API is guaranteed to be stable from one
release to the next. In fact, it is very likely that the API will change multiple times before a
stable 1.0.0 release. In practice, this means that upgrading `hya` to a new version will
possibly break any code that was using the old version of `hya`.
