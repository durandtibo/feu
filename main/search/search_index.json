First, you will need to install <code>poetry</code>. <code>poetry</code> is used to manage and install the dependencies. If <code>poetry</code> is already installed on your machine, you can skip this step. There are several ways to install <code>poetry</code> so you can use the one that you prefer. You can check the <code>poetry</code> installation by running the following command:</p> <pre><code>poetry --version\n</code></pre> <p>Then, you can clone the git repository:</p> <pre><code>git clone git@github.com:durandtibo/feu.git\n</code></pre> <p>It is recommended to create a Python 3.8+ virtual environment. This step is optional so you can skip it. To create a virtual environment, you can use the following command:</p> <pre><code>make conda\n</code></pre> <p>It automatically creates a conda virtual environment. When the virtual environment is created, you can activate it with the following command:</p> <pre><code>conda activate feu\n</code></pre> <p>This example uses <code>conda</code> to create a virtual environment, but you can use other tools or configurations. Then, you should install the required package to use <code>feu</code> with the following command:</p> <pre><code>make install\n</code></pre> <p>This command will install all the required packages. You can also use this command to update the required packages. This command will check if there is a more recent package available and will install it. Finally, you can test the installation with the following command:</p> <pre><code>make unit-test-cov\n</code></pre>"}]}
